            Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries
            must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this
            menace, hence the birth of iReporter. iReporter enables any/every
            citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate
            authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things
            that needs government intervention
